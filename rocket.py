McGill Rocket Team Flight Simulator
Authors: Matt Saathoff, Mei Qi Tang

The Rocket class creates a rocket model that includes a Motor and Airframe. The Motor is further separated
in a Tank, Chamber, and Nozzle. This class only contains the hard "specs" about the rocket. It only defines
the properties of the rocket and not its flight behaviour for example.
